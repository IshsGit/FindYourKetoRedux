A freshly fried piece of white meat chicken breast takes center stage in a refreshing and healthy lettuce wrap. Instead of typical breadcrumbs, the breading is made with Keto pork rinds. A cajun-inspired mayo is spread all over the inside, and the chicken is topped with chopped pickle too. This lunch is like a hot Nashville chicken sandwich with a Keto twist and a little less “hot”. It may not best the best for meal prep recipes, due to the lettuce wrap. However, you can follow the directions below to learn how to prep ahead larger quantities of this Keto meal to save you time in the kitchen.\\n\\n### Meal Prepping This Recipe\\n\\nIf you made the Keto chicken wraps entirely ahead of time, you’d have a very soggy salad in your refrigerator when the lettuce wraps go limp! However, you can prep these ingredients separately for an easy meal you can put together in the middle of the week without any cooking. Increase the ingredient list to reflect the amount of servings you want to make. Fry the chicken breasts in batches, and make sure they fully cool before storing away in a container in your refrigerator. Prepare the cajun mayo and chopped pickle, but store them separately in your refrigerator. When it’s time for lunch, simply lay down your lettuce leaves, arrange the prepare ingredients, wrap, and enjoy!\\n\\n### Using Your Favorite Pickle\\n\\nThis Keto recipe recommends using your “favorite pickle” when assembling your chicken wrap. Pickles can add a great flavor component, and the right one can pair perfectly with the cajun mayo. If you happen to enjoy homemade pickles, ask whoever made them if they used any sugar when creating the pickle brine. If your favorite pickle is storebought, check the labels. Many top-brand pickle companies add tons of extra sugar, but there are low-sugar options on grocery store shelves. Only trust yourself? You can make your own pickles by following either the Carb Manager Keto Bread And Butter Pickles or the Carb Manager Keto Quick Pickle With Red Peppers.\\n\\nJessica L.","prepareTime":17,"cookTime":10,"ingredients":[{"name":"Paleo Baking Flour by Bob\'s Red Mill","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"1-½ teaspoon","qty":1.5,"grams":3,"scale":0.031}},{"name":"Raw Egg","servingSize":{"units":"large","desc":"½ large","qty":0.5,"grams":25,"scale":0.5}},{"name":"Fried Pork Rinds","servingSize":{"units":"ounce","desc":"1 ounce","qty":1,"grams":28,"scale":1}},{"name":"Chicken Breast Boneless Skinless Raw","servingSize":{"units":"oz","desc":"4 oz","qty":4,"grams":113,"scale":0.48}},{"name":"Salt","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Black Pepper","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Garlic Powder","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Onion Powder","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Avocado Oil","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"2 tablespoon","qty":2,"grams":27,"scale":2}},{"name":"Mayonnaise","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"1 tablespoon","qty":1,"grams":14,"scale":1}},{"name":"Ketchup","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"½ teaspoon","qty":0.5,"grams":2,"scale":0.167}},{"name":"Paprika","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"¼ teaspoon","qty":0.25,"scale":0.25}},{"name":"Cumin, Ground","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"¼ teaspoon","qty":0.25,"scale":0.25}},{"name":"Garlic Powder","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Thyme, Dried","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Lemon Juice","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"¼ teaspoon","qty":0.25,"scale":0.25}},{"name":"Pickles","servingSize":{"units":"ounce","desc":"¼ ounce","qty":0.25,"grams":7,"scale":0.05}},{"name":"Iceberg Lettuce","servingSize":{"units":"ounce","desc":"2 ounce","qty":2,"grams":57,"scale":0.995}}],"steps":["Prepare the breading station first.

Using this vegan Keto ground beef recipe as a meal prep staple will make your time in the kitchen so much easier and convenient. There are so many things you can do with this recipe. You can incorporate this recipe into a larger main course, add it to basic salads and sandwiches, or serve it as is with a vegan Keto side dish. The ground tofu is full of flavor, which you can intensify with marination or adding more seasonings to your taste. For storage, keep the finished ground tofu in air-tight containers in your refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can simply reheat it in your microwave or add it to skillet meals.\\n\\n### Suggestions For Use\\n\\nBefore cooking the tofu, you can add other ingredients to turn the ground tofu mixture into a meatloaf or meatballs. Add nutritional yeast or ground almonds to the mixture as a binder before forming it in a pan or dish. After cooking the ground tofu as described in the directions, you can add it to simple meals for more protein and calories. Top off your taco and burrito bowls with the ground tofu, or add it to real Keto tacos made with Keto taco shells. Add a scoop to your salads or on top of cauliflower rice.\\n\\n### Do I Have To Use Extra Firm Tofu?\\n\\nIf you don’t have access to extra firm tofu, you can use regular firm tofu as a substitution. In this case, you may need to cook it for longer in your pan and you’ll need to be more gentle when working with the tofu.

This comforting Keto mocha is a great go-to drink, perfect for boosting your fats throughout the day. Alternatively, enjoy on its own or alongside one of our Keto breakfasts to kickstart your morning.\\n\\n### How to make this dairy-free Keto coffee?\\n\\nIt is easy to get all the fats and flavor in your BULLETPROOF® coffee without the need for dairy. We have used coconut oil and cacao butter as our dairy free fat sources. The cacao butter not only adds a rich source of nutritious fats, but also contributes to the creamy chocolate flavor. Once the fats are melted into the hot coffee they are blended until velvety smooth with a light froth on top.\\n\\n### Here are some tips for making this Keto coffee:\\n\\nWe have used coconut oil and cacao butter to load our coffee with healthy fats. You may however substitute the coconut oil with BULLETPROOF® Brain Octane Oil (MCT Oil) if preferred or use a combination of fats. We have also added a little low carb sweetener to help enhance the flavor of the cacao butter. You may use an alternate low carb sweetener if desired. Please be sure to update your macros to reflect any changes.\\n\\n### What is the best chocolate to use for this Keto drink?\\n\\nTo limit the number of carbs and keep this recipe Keto-friendly, we are using cocoa powder. While you can use a sugar-free chocolate bar to make this Keto beverage, it usually contains more carbs. Using a chocolate bar will also increase the preparation time since you must melt it.\\n\\nBULLETPROOF® is a registered trademark owned by Bulletproof Digital, Inc.","prepareTime":10,"cookTime":2,"ingredients":[{"name":"100% Pure Erythritol by Now","servingSize":{"units":"tsp","desc":"2 tsp","qty":2,"grams":8,"scale":2}},{"name":"Almond Milk, Vanilla Or Other Flavors, Unsweetened","servingSize":{"units":"cup","desc":"1 cup","qty":1,"grams":240,"scale":1}},{"name":"Cocoa Powder, Unsweetened","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"1 tablespoon","qty":1,"grams":5,"scale":3}},{"name":"Raw Cacao Butter by Sunfood","servingSize":{"units":"tbsp","desc":"1 tbsp","qty":1,"grams":14,"scale":1}},{"name":"Coconut Oil","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"1 tablespoon","qty":1,"grams":14,"scale":1}},{"name":"Black Coffee","servingSize":{"units":"cup","desc":"½ cup","qty":0.5,"grams":118,"scale":4}}],"steps":["Add your hot coffee to a large mug then add the cocoa powder, cacao butter, coconut oil and erythritol.

A freshly fried piece of white meat chicken breast takes center stage in a refreshing and healthy lettuce wrap. Instead of typical breadcrumbs, the breading is made with Keto pork rinds. A cajun-inspired mayo is spread all over the inside, and the chicken is topped with chopped pickle too. This lunch is like a hot Nashville chicken sandwich with a Keto twist and a little less “hot”. It may not best the best for meal prep recipes, due to the lettuce wrap. However, you can follow the directions below to learn how to prep ahead larger quantities of this Keto meal to save you time in the kitchen.\\n\\n### Meal Prepping This Recipe\\n\\nIf you made the Keto chicken wraps entirely ahead of time, you’d have a very soggy salad in your refrigerator when the lettuce wraps go limp! However, you can prep these ingredients separately for an easy meal you can put together in the middle of the week without any cooking. Increase the ingredient list to reflect the amount of servings you want to make. Fry the chicken breasts in batches, and make sure they fully cool before storing away in a container in your refrigerator. Prepare the cajun mayo and chopped pickle, but store them separately in your refrigerator. When it’s time for lunch, simply lay down your lettuce leaves, arrange the prepare ingredients, wrap, and enjoy!\\n\\n### Using Your Favorite Pickle\\n\\nThis Keto recipe recommends using your “favorite pickle” when assembling your chicken wrap. Pickles can add a great flavor component, and the right one can pair perfectly with the cajun mayo. If you happen to enjoy homemade pickles, ask whoever made them if they used any sugar when creating the pickle brine. If your favorite pickle is storebought, check the labels. Many top-brand pickle companies add tons of extra sugar, but there are low-sugar options on grocery store shelves. Only trust yourself? You can make your own pickles by following either the Carb Manager Keto Bread And Butter Pickles or the Carb Manager Keto Quick Pickle With Red Peppers.\\n\\nJessica L.","prepareTime":17,"cookTime":10,"ingredients":[{"name":"Paleo Baking Flour by Bob\'s Red Mill","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"1-½ teaspoon","qty":1.5,"grams":3,"scale":0.031}},{"name":"Raw Egg","servingSize":{"units":"large","desc":"½ large","qty":0.5,"grams":25,"scale":0.5}},{"name":"Fried Pork Rinds","servingSize":{"units":"ounce","desc":"1 ounce","qty":1,"grams":28,"scale":1}},{"name":"Chicken Breast Boneless Skinless Raw","servingSize":{"units":"oz","desc":"4 oz","qty":4,"grams":113,"scale":0.48}},{"name":"Salt","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Black Pepper","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Garlic Powder","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Onion Powder","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Avocado Oil","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"2 tablespoon","qty":2,"grams":27,"scale":2}},{"name":"Mayonnaise","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"1 tablespoon","qty":1,"grams":14,"scale":1}},{"name":"Ketchup","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"½ teaspoon","qty":0.5,"grams":2,"scale":0.167}},{"name":"Paprika","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"¼ teaspoon","qty":0.25,"scale":0.25}},{"name":"Cumin, Ground","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"¼ teaspoon","qty":0.25,"scale":0.25}},{"name":"Garlic Powder","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Thyme, Dried","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"⅛ teaspoon","qty":0.125,"scale":0.125}},{"name":"Lemon Juice","servingSize":{"units":"teaspoon","desc":"¼ teaspoon","qty":0.25,"scale":0.25}},{"name":"Pickles","servingSize":{"units":"ounce","desc":"¼ ounce","qty":0.25,"grams":7,"scale":0.05}},{"name":"Iceberg Lettuce","servingSize":{"units":"ounce","desc":"2 ounce","qty":2,"grams":57,"scale":0.995}}],"steps":["Prepare the breading station first.

Using this vegan Keto ground beef recipe as a meal prep staple will make your time in the kitchen so much easier and convenient. There are so many things you can do with this recipe. You can incorporate this recipe into a larger main course, add it to basic salads and sandwiches, or serve it as is with a vegan Keto side dish. The ground tofu is full of flavor, which you can intensify with marination or adding more seasonings to your taste. For storage, keep the finished ground tofu in air-tight containers in your refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can simply reheat it in your microwave or add it to skillet meals.\\n\\n### Suggestions For Use\\n\\nBefore cooking the tofu, you can add other ingredients to turn the ground tofu mixture into a meatloaf or meatballs. Add nutritional yeast or ground almonds to the mixture as a binder before forming it in a pan or dish. After cooking the ground tofu as described in the directions, you can add it to simple meals for more protein and calories. Top off your taco and burrito bowls with the ground tofu, or add it to real Keto tacos made with Keto taco shells. Add a scoop to your salads or on top of cauliflower rice.\\n\\n### Do I Have To Use Extra Firm Tofu?\\n\\nIf you don’t have access to extra firm tofu, you can use regular firm tofu as a substitution. In this case, you may need to cook it for longer in your pan and you’ll need to be more gentle when working with the tofu.

This comforting Keto mocha is a great go-to drink, perfect for boosting your fats throughout the day. Alternatively, enjoy on its own or alongside one of our Keto breakfasts to kickstart your morning.\\n\\n### How to make this dairy-free Keto coffee?\\n\\nIt is easy to get all the fats and flavor in your BULLETPROOF® coffee without the need for dairy. We have used coconut oil and cacao butter as our dairy free fat sources. The cacao butter not only adds a rich source of nutritious fats, but also contributes to the creamy chocolate flavor. Once the fats are melted into the hot coffee they are blended until velvety smooth with a light froth on top.\\n\\n### Here are some tips for making this Keto coffee:\\n\\nWe have used coconut oil and cacao butter to load our coffee with healthy fats. You may however substitute the coconut oil with BULLETPROOF® Brain Octane Oil (MCT Oil) if preferred or use a combination of fats. We have also added a little low carb sweetener to help enhance the flavor of the cacao butter. You may use an alternate low carb sweetener if desired. Please be sure to update your macros to reflect any changes.\\n\\n### What is the best chocolate to use for this Keto drink?\\n\\nTo limit the number of carbs and keep this recipe Keto-friendly, we are using cocoa powder. While you can use a sugar-free chocolate bar to make this Keto beverage, it usually contains more carbs. Using a chocolate bar will also increase the preparation time since you must melt it.\\n\\nBULLETPROOF® is a registered trademark owned by Bulletproof Digital, Inc.","prepareTime":10,"cookTime":2,"ingredients":[{"name":"100% Pure Erythritol by Now","servingSize":{"units":"tsp","desc":"2 tsp","qty":2,"grams":8,"scale":2}},{"name":"Almond Milk, Vanilla Or Other Flavors, Unsweetened","servingSize":{"units":"cup","desc":"1 cup","qty":1,"grams":240,"scale":1}},{"name":"Cocoa Powder, Unsweetened","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"1 tablespoon","qty":1,"grams":5,"scale":3}},{"name":"Raw Cacao Butter by Sunfood","servingSize":{"units":"tbsp","desc":"1 tbsp","qty":1,"grams":14,"scale":1}},{"name":"Coconut Oil","servingSize":{"units":"tablespoon","desc":"1 tablespoon","qty":1,"grams":14,"scale":1}},{"name":"Black Coffee","servingSize":{"units":"cup","desc":"½ cup","qty":0.5,"grams":118,"scale":4}}],"steps":["Add your hot coffee to a large mug then add the cocoa powder, cacao butter, coconut oil and erythritol.

We have used unsalted butter, a little cream cheese and powdered erythritol to create our buttercream truffle base. Once blended, the truffle mixture needs to be refrigerated and chilled until firm enough to scoop and shape into individual truffles. This will take several hours and is best left overnight. If you do not wish to use erythritol you may use an alternative low carb powdered sweetener, adjusting quantities to taste.\\n\\n### Hints and Tips\\n\\nThese Keto buttercream truffles have been flavored with ginger, cinnamon and orange extract. The truffles are then dusted in unsweetened cocoa powder to finish. You may alter the flavorings as desired and may omit the spices if you wish.
